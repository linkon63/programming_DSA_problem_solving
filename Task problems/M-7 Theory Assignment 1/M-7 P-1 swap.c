/*
1. Update the following code such that
it swaps the contents of two two variables.
You can only write code inside the two comments.
Do not modify anything else. The printf function
is supposed to print “13 and 5”. So basically
the value must be swapped but you can not assign 13
directly to a and 5 directly to b. You can not use
other numbers as well. But you can declare an extra variable if you need.
int a=5, b=13;
//Write code here
//End of code
printf(“%d and %d” , a, b);

*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a=5, b=13;
    //Write code here
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
    //End of code
    printf("%d and %d", a, b);

    return 0;
}
